# Find the Gold

## Purpose
The objective of this game is to be the first player to find the gold button. All players start out with 5000 points. Everytime a player selects a button that is not the gold button, the player will lose points. The amount of points lost depends on the particular button. If a player loses all 5000 points, the player is out of the game.
